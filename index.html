        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The Online Etymology Dictionary provides anecdotal evidence as well as linguistic, saying that the term derives probably from Old English *picg, found in compounds, ultimate origin unknown. Originally "young pig" (the word for adults was swine). Apparently related to Low German bigge, Dutch big ("but the phonology is difficult" -- OED). ... Another Old English word for "pig" was fearh, related to furh "furrow," from PIE *perk- "dig, furrow" (source also of Latin porc-us "pig," see pork). "This reflects a widespread IE tendency to name animals from typical attributes or activities" [Roger Lass]. Synonyms grunter, oinker are from sailors' and fishermen's euphemistic avoidance of uttering the word pig at sea, a superstition perhaps based on the fate of the Gadarene swine, who drowned. The Online Etymology Dictionary also traces the evolution of sow, the term for a female pig, through various historical languages:
        Old English sugu, su "female of the swine," from Proto-Germanic *su- (cognates: Old Saxon, Old High German su, German Sau, Dutch zeug, Old Norse syr), from PIE root *su- (cognates: Sanskrit sukarah "wild boar, swine;" Avestan hu "wild boar;" Greek hys "swine;" Latin sus "swine", suinus "pertaining to swine"; Old Church Slavonic svinija "swine;" Lettish sivens "young pig;" Welsh hucc, Irish suig "swine; Old Irish socc "snout, plowshare"), possibly imitative of pig noise;note that Sanskrit sukharah means "maker of (the sound) su. It is entirely likely that the word to call pigs, "soo-ie," is similarly derived.</p>

                <h5>Fun Facts about Pigs!</h5>
                <p>A pig’s snout is an important and powerful tool that helps these animals find food and navigate the world. The pig’s snout is very flexible, allowing pigs to root out food from the ground. Farmers even use pigs to search for valuable truffle mushrooms hidden underneath the dirt.</p>

                <h5>Fun Facts about Pigs!</h5>
                <p>Pigs are sprinters — which means they can run really fast for a short distance, but then they tire out easily. A domestic pig can run at speeds of around 17 km/h, and wild pigs can run even faster. Even though they can weigh up to 91 kilograms each, a wild pig can run at speeds of around 50 km/h.</p>
